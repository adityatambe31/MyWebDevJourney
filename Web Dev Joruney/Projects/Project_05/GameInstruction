Welcome to the wild and wacky world of Slot Machine Game! Buckle up and get ready for a rollercoaster ride of luck, spins, and potential riches. 

Here's everything you need to know to dive into the fun:

How to Play:

Deposit Your Money 💵:
- Start by entering the amount of money you want to deposit. Remember, no imaginary dollars here—only the real (or at least code-real) stuff!

Choose Your Lines 🔢:
- Decide how many lines you want to bet on. You can choose between 1 and 3 lines. More lines mean more chances to win, but also more places to lose!

Place Your Bet 🎲:
- Enter the amount you want to bet on each line. Make sure it's within your balance and doesn't exceed your math skills.

Spin the Slot Machine 🎰:
- Watch the magic happen as the slot machine spins and symbols align (or don't). Cross your fingers, toes, and anything else you’ve got for good luck!

Check Your Winnings 🏆:
The machine will check if you’ve hit the jackpot. If all symbols in any line match, you win! Each symbol has a different value:
- A: 5x your bet
- B: 4x your bet
- C: 3x your bet
- D: 2x your bet

Collect Your Winnings 💰:
-If you’ve won, the amount will be added to your balance. If not, well, better luck next time!

Play Again? 🔁:
-If you still have money left, you can choose to play again. Just type ‘y’ to continue or ‘n’ to cash out and call it a day.


Rules:
-You must have a positive balance to place a bet.
-Bets are deducted before the spin, and winnings are added after checking the result.
-If you run out of money, the game will sadly end, and you’ll need to start over.

Pro Tips:
-Bet wisely! Don’t blow all your cash in one go unless you're feeling extra lucky.
-The more lines you bet on, the higher your chances of winning (and losing!).
-Keep an eye on your balance and know when to walk away—there’s always another spin tomorrow.
-Now, get spinning, have fun, and may the slots be ever in your favor! 🎉
